# Vulkan Grapher

WIP to build a Vulkan + imGui version of our 3D function grapher.

To get started we're building on the Vulkan + imGui framework in [vk-sandbox](https://github.com/tstullich/vk-sandbox).

## First Steps

__Understand all the present Vulkan and imGui code.__

This will probably be the most work of the project, as we have two other
versions of the 3D function grapher alread: One in OpenGL and another in
Rust with WGPU + egui.
